# Library Management System

This is a simple library management system implemented in Java, which allows users to add books and users, display books, search for books by name or user ID, manage borrowing and returning books, and view books to be returned.

## How to Use

1. Run the program.
2. Click on the respective buttons to perform different operations:
    - **Add book:** Add a new book to the library.
    - **Add User:** Add a new user to the library.
    - **Display books:** Display all books currently in the library.
    - **Search book by Name:** Search for a book by its name or author's name.
    - **Search book by UserID:** Search for a user by their ID.
    - **Books to be returned:** Display books in the library that need to be returned.
    - **Return book:** Return a book to the library.
    - **Borrow Book:** Borrow a book from the library.
    - **Exit:** Close the application.

## File Structure

The program utilizes three text files for data storage:
- **book.txt:** Stores information about books.
- **users.txt:** Stores information about users.
- **lib.txt:** Stores the last used IDs for books and users.

## Note

This implementation uses a graphical user interface (GUI) for user interaction.
